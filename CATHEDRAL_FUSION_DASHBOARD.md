# Cathedral Modular Research & Fusion Dashboard

## üß† Master Memory & System Awareness
This dashboard is the living source of truth for the entire Cathedral ecosystem. It merges and links all master files and memory systems so every important bit remembers every other:
- **PRIME_SOURCE_HUB.md** ‚Äî Centralized research, story/game logic, character guides, meta layers, design, error fixes, registry/data contracts.
- **CATHEDRAL_STRUCTURE_MAP.md** ‚Äî Complete business architecture, app purposes, interconnections, user journey, development priorities, and memory activation checklist.
- **CATHEDRAL_ERROR_PREVENTION_SYSTEM.md** ‚Äî Error prevention rules, git/file system protocols, code enhancement, session continuity, and quality assurance.
- **CATHEDRAL_TRINITY_NAMING_SYSTEM.md** ‚Äî Numerological naming, branding, visual identity, typography, and suite synergy for the three sacred apps.
- **SESSION_MEMORY_COMPLETE.md** ‚Äî Full session continuity log, business identity, naming history, repository structure, critical errors to avoid, and future session reminders.
All these files are cross-referenced and summarized here. Any update to one should be reflected in this dashboard for total system memory and continuity.

## üèõÔ∏è Core Apps & Projects
- **LIBER ARCANAE**: Living Arcana Deck (archetypes, tarot, story engine)
- **CODEX MAGNA**: Wisdom/Grimoire System (research, knowledge, correspondences)
- **GEOMETRIX NOVA**: Sacred Geometry, Art, and Music Engine (visuals, sound, generative modules)
- **Magical Mystery House**: Creative playground, fusion lab, and node explorer

## üìö Datasets & Modular Resources
- **Nodes**: `/packages/data/codex144/nodes.json` ‚Äî Node ID, archetype, numerology, correspondences
- **Angels**: `/packages/codex-144/angels-72.json` ‚Äî Angel registry, attributes, invocation, numerology
- **Demons**: `/packages/codex-144/demons-72.json` ‚Äî Demon registry, balancing angel, healing aspect
- **Stylepacks**: `/ARTIFACTS-RESEARCH/stylepacks.json` ‚Äî Palettes, motifs, textures, glyphs, references
- **Health Lattice**: `/assets/health-lattice/health-lattice-data.json` ‚Äî Node, metric, value, timestamp
- **Grimoire Concepts**: `/assets/grimoire-concepts/grimoire-concepts.json` ‚Äî Concept, correspondence, codex link

## üåå Immersive, Generative, Non-Square Navigation
- The Cathedral system is designed for immersive, realm-walking experiences‚Äîno more stressful, square/cube or circle/sphere limitations.
- Navigation, buttons, and frames can be modular, organic, and generative (think: flowing, crystalline, fractal, or architectural forms).
- The system can self-generate new realms, layouts, and features based on what you select, so every experience feels unique and alive.
- Select features, buttons, and frames are designed for beauty, sense, and ease‚Äînot stress or embarrassment.
- You can walk into different realms, explore real 3D space, and let the architecture and art evolve with your choices.

## üî≤ Boundaries & Definitions for Clarity and Creative Play
- **Science**: Real facts, proven research, and empirical data. Used for health lattice, numerology, geometry, and any module requiring accuracy and reproducibility.
- **Art**: Creative expression, generative visuals, music, and design. Used for stylepacks, generative art, sound engines, and immersive UI.
- **Real Facts**: Data and information that can be verified (e.g., mathematical ratios, historical sources, physical laws). Clearly marked in datasets and modules.
- **Archetype**: Universal patterns, mythic roles, and story engines. Used for tarot, character guides, and narrative modules.
- **Symbol**: Visual, sonic, or conceptual icons that carry meaning. Used for node overlays, UI elements, and ritual protocols.
- **Open Source Resource**: Freely available assets, code, and datasets. Used for art, music, code libraries, and sample packs‚Äîalways cited and tracked for provenance.

### How Each Connects to Nodes
- Every node (angel, archetype, concept, etc.) can be tagged with science, art, fact, archetype, symbol, and open source resource links.
- Nodes can be played with and remixed: select a node, view its boundaries, and connect it to art, music, fractal, color, and sound modules.
- Patterns from all esoteric systems (tarot, astrology, geometry, alchemy) can be explored visually and sonically, with clear boundaries between fact, symbol, and creative play.
- The dashboard and apps will always show what is science, what is art, what is archetype, and what is symbol‚Äîso you never feel lost or smushed.

## üîó Interconnections & Fusion
- All datasets and modules are cross-linked and accessible to every app
- Node fusion: Mix and match settings, assets, and logic (A + B = D)
- Creative API: Functions for generative art, sound, story, geometry
- Portal system: Seamless movement between apps and modules
- Immersive navigation and generative architecture: The system supports non-square, non-sphere, and non-flat layouts, so you can explore, play, and create in ways that feel natural and inspiring.

# Cathedral Modular Research & Fusion Dashboard

This dashboard organizes all your research interests, datasets, modules, and app connections for creative fusion and exploration. It is designed for a multi-project, multi-app, modular system‚Äîno stubs, just real info and links to your actual resources.
